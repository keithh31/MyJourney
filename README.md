My journey starts off in the beuatiful island, Puerto Rico. I am full Puerto Rican yet I have only been to Puerto Rico a couple times. Every moment spent on that island is cherrished because my time there is limitted. I spend time with family and enjoy the environment. I honestly feel like there is nothjing better than doing what you love where you love. For me, one of the only places I actually like to be submerged into is puerto rico. New york is great but my Journey will start and end there. Puerto Rico is too special to be a one and done kind of vacation. For me being there is everything, the feeling of being in your hometown is the best feeling because you literally feel like you are at home. If you feel like this its because you are, dont be afraid to let your true colors show.
